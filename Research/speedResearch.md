# Speed Research
## 2 Wire Motor
100 RPM on Free Spin

## Wheels
4.07" Diameter Wheels
2.035

## Gearing 
60 Tooth on Motor
12 Tooth on Wheel

# Speed Math
100 R/M * 5 Gearing = 500 RPM on Wheel

2pi(2.035") * 500 = 532 ft/min = 8 ft/sec = 5.45 mph

__Theoretical Maximum Speed (No weight or Friction) = 5.45 mph__
